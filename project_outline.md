# DevOps Project Summary

GitHub Repository URL: https://github.com/raneemsalahh/devops-web-deployment.git

Final Web Server Status: Successfully deployed on the Ubuntu VM. The web server is running on port 80 and displays the updated content from Student B, including professional styling and clear indication that it was "Updated by Student B".

Collaboration Notes: Git collaboration cycle completed successfully. Student A set up the infrastructure, Ansible playbook, and initial files. Student B updated the web content (docker/index.html) and pushed changes. Student A pulled the changes and verified the full pipeline on the VM (Ansible installed Docker → Docker build → Docker run), confirming the final web page works correctly.
